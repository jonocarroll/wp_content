Well, I made it after all! Helped in part by a day of foot pain that restricted me to bed (with laptop), and sticking to it every night I could, I have now completed the <a title="NaNoWriMo" href="http://jcarroll.com.au/?p=62">NaNoWriMo</a> challenge; 50,000 words towards a novel in one month.

It's far from complete, I don't even have the ending in there yet, but I'm pretty proud that I've managed to get it done. I'm happy with the way that some of the scenes have more or less written themselves, and there's a lot more character development to go back and fix up. Finishing it off and doing all the editing seems like such an easy task in comparison. I'm still planning to see if I can get last year's effort up to scratch. Perhaps I'll have a little more spare time to work on that now. If you haven't had a go yet, and you would like to see if you have what it takes to smash out enough words for a novel, consider giving it a try next year.

If I do manage to get it all together in one place, edited, and ready to read, I'll put it up on here under a Creative Commons licence. For now, here's the sketchy cover design.
