<a title="Project Euler" href="http://jcarroll.com.au/2015/01/code/project-euler/" target="_blank">Explanation</a>. Standard caveat: don't look here if you are trying to do these yourself.
<blockquote>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</blockquote>
Getting a little trickier already. I initially attempted this one by a recursive brute-force search of each step in the sequence;

[code language="r"]
## recursively define the Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci &lt;- function(x) {
   y &lt;- ifelse(x &gt; 1, fibonacci(x-1)+fibonacci(x-2), x)
   return(y)
}

## values in fibonacci &lt; 4e6
z &lt;- 4e6L
## check i=20,30,40
fibonacci(20) # 6765
fibonacci(30) # 832040
fibonacci(40) # takes too long
[/code]

But of course these solutions are supposed to be calculable in <a title="Project Euler : About" href="https://projecteuler.net/about" target="_blank">about a minute</a> so I've taken a wrong turn.

It quickly became obvious that I was needlessly re-calculating each step to add another, which is silly, as this explicitly needs all of them each time. I decided to store the sequence as a <code>data.frame</code> to keep the iteration number alongside it. Note that I use the more correct definition of the sequence which starts with 1, 1, 2. That's not going to be an issue here, as we're summing the even values anyway.

[code language="r"]
## this is silly, why recompute every time?
fibonacci.seq &lt;- data.frame(n=integer(), f=integer())
fibonacci.seq[1,] &lt;- c(1,1)
fibonacci.seq[2,] &lt;- c(1,1)
w &lt;- 2
f &lt;- fibonacci.seq$f[w]
while(f &lt; z) {
 w &lt;- w + 1
 fibonacci.seq[w,] &lt;- data.frame(n=w, f=fibonacci.seq$f[w-1]+fibonacci.seq$f[w-2])
 f &lt;- fibonacci.seq$f[w]
}
fibonacci.seq

## sum of even values
sum(fibonacci.seq[fibonacci.seq$f %% 2 == 0, &quot;f&quot;]) # 4613732

### CORRECT
