I'm participating in National Novel Writing Month [NaNoWriMo] - writing a 50,000 word novel in one month. I tried last year and only made it half way. This year's effort is looking better, but I've had a few wordless days (you need about 1700/day on average). 

Here's my blurb:



<blockquote>
The room slowly quieted as the doors swung aside and the president entered, flanked by his bodyguards and chief of staff. The barely perceptible clicks of a dozen or so digital recorders was enough to hush the remaining informal discussions. Chairs shuffled. Papers were involuntarily wiped clean in preparation for notes. The president cleared his throat. "Good morning ladies and gentleman, we'll try to keep this brief". As he spoke, his voice became fainter. In fact, *he* became fainter, seemingly becomming translucent. It wasn't until the president had entirely vanished that the minds of those in the room managed to process what had just happened - the president had just disappeared in front of their eyes.
