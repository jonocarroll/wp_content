This started out as a "hey, I wonder" sort of thing, but as usual, they tend to end up as interesting voyages into the deepest depths of code.

<a href="http://www.happylittlescripts.com/2018/09/make-your-r-code-nicer-with-roperators.html">This post</a> came across my feed last week, referring to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=roperators">roperators package on CRAN</a>. In that post, the author introduces an infix operator from that package which 'adds' (concatenates) strings

[code language="r"]
&quot;using infix (%) operators&quot; %+% &quot;R can do simple string addition&quot;
#&gt; [1] &quot;using infix (%) operators R can do simple string addition&quot;
[/code]

This might be familiar if you use python

[code language="python"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;python &quot; + &quot;adds &quot; + &quot;strings&quot;
'python adds strings'
[/code] 

or javascript

[code language="javascript"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;python &quot; + &quot;adds &quot; + &quot;strings&quot;
'python adds strings'
[/code]
