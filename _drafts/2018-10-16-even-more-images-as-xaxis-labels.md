This is the last update to this strange saga... I hope.

Easily two of the most popular posts on my blog are <a href="https://jcarroll.com.au/2016/06/02/images-as-x-axis-labels/">this one</a> and <a href="https://jcarroll.com.au/2016/06/03/images-as-x-axis-labels-updated/">this one</a> describing a couple of ways in which I managed to hack together using an image as a category label in a ggplot. 

There are likely many people who believe one should _never_ do such a thing, but given the popularity, it seems a lot of people aren't listening to that. Good on you.

One of these posts was recently shared again by the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme">#rstats amplifier Mara Averick</a> (if you're not following her on Twitter, you're missing out) and <a href="https://twitter.com/baptiste_auguie">@baptiste_auguie</a> (the saviour of the previous implementation) mentioned that he had seen a 'hack' to get chemical symbols as a categorical axis label using <code>tikzDevice</code>. That package leverages [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] (of which I am _very_ familiar, having written my PhD thesis entirely in [latex]\LaTeX[/latex]many moons ago) to treat all of the text in an image into rendered output, assuming that it contains valid [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] commands.

The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ggplot2/OPhpWtVcwtY">example code</a> is straightforward enough

[code language="r" light="true"]
options(tikzLatexPackages = 
c(getOption('tikzLatexPackages'),&quot;\\usepackage{acide-amine}\n&quot;)) 

d = data.frame(x=1:10, y=1:10, f=factor(sample(letters[1:2], 10, repl=TRUE))) 

p &lt;- qplot(x,y,data=d) + theme_bw() + 
  opts(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 5, 1), &quot;lines&quot;), 
       axis.text.x = theme_text(size = 12 * 
        0.8, lineheight = 0.9, vjust = 10)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2, 8), labels=c(&quot;\\phe{15}&quot;, &quot;\\leu{15}&quot;)) 

tikz(&quot;annotation.tex&quot;,standAlone=T,width=4,height=4) 
print(p) 
dev.off() 
[/code]

and produces this

This got me curious, though -- if it can process $\LaTeX$, could it process a <code>\\includegraphics</code> call?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Efficient! If it&#39;s arbitrary LaTeX, could the labels just be \includegraphics calls?</p>&mdash; Jonathan Carroll (@carroll_jono) <a href="https://twitter.com/carroll_jono/status/1050535371241476096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2018</a></blockquote>

Yes, as it turns out.

A quick test showed that it was indeed possible, which only leaves re-implementing the previous posts' images using this method.

I've done so, and the code isn't particularly shorter than the other method.

Producing nearly the same end result.

There are a few differences compared to the previous version(s):

 - I had a request for rotating the additional text, which I actually <a href="https://gist.github.com/jonocarroll/2f9490f1f5e7c82ef8b791a4b91fc9ca#file-images_as_xaxis_labels_updated-r">also updated recently</a>, and it seemed to fit better, so I rotated the labels within the [latex]\LaTeX[/latex]command.
 - Since all of the text has been rendered via [latex]\LaTeX[/latex], the fonts are a bit different.
 - The rankings have since changed, so I've added an 11th to keep Australia in the list.

The [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] component of this also meant that a few changes were necessary in the other labels, such as the dollar sign in the y-axis label, and the underscores throughout (these are considered special characters in [latex]\LaTeX[/latex]. Lastly, the result of running the <code>tikz</code> command is that a <code>.tex</code> ([latex]\LaTeX[/latex]source code) file is produced. This isn't quite the plot image file we want. It _does_ however have the commands to generate one. The last steps in the above gist are to process this <code>.tex</code> file with [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] (here I used the <code>tools::texi2dvi</code> function, but one _could_ also use a <code>system</code> command to their [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] installation.

That still only produced a PDF. The last step was to use the <code>magick</code> package to convert this into an image.

Overall, this is a nice proof of concept, but I don't think it's a particularly tidy way of achieving the goal of image axis labels.
