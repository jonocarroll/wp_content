This is the last update to this strange saga... I hope.

<!--more-->

Easily two of the most popular posts on my blog are <a href="https://jcarroll.com.au/2016/06/02/images-as-x-axis-labels/">this one</a> and <a href="https://jcarroll.com.au/2016/06/03/images-as-x-axis-labels-updated/">this one</a> describing a couple of ways in which I managed to hack together using an image as a category label in a ggplot. There are likely many people who believe one should _never_ do such a thing, but given the popularity, it seems a lot of people aren't listening to that. Good on you.

One of these posts was recently shared again by the amazing #rstats amplifier Mara Averick (if you're not following her on Twitter, you're missing out) and @baptiste_auguie (the saviour of the previous implementation) mentioned that he had seen a 'hack' to get chemical symbols as a categorical axis label using tikzDevice. That package leverages LaTeX (of which I am _very_ familiar, having written my PhD thesis entirely in LaTeX many moons ago) to treat all of the text in an image into rendered output, assuming that it contains valid LaTeX commands.

This got me curious, though -- if it can process LaTeX, could it process a <code>\\includegraphics</code> call?

Yes, as it turns out. 

A quick test showed that it was indeed possible, which only leaves re-implementing the previous posts' images using this method.

I've done so, and the code isn't particularly shorter than the other method.

Producing nearly the same end result.

There are a few differences with the previous version(s):

 - I had a request for rotating the additional text, which I actually <a href="https://gist.github.com/jonocarroll/2f9490f1f5e7c82ef8b791a4b91fc9ca#file-images_as_xaxis_labels_updated-r">also updated recently</a>, and it seemed to fit better, so I rotated the labels within the LaTeX command.
 - Since all of the text has been rendered via LaTeX, the fonts are a bit different.
 - The rankings have since changed, so I've added an 11th to keep Australia in the list.

The LaTeX component of this also meant that a few changes were necessary in the other labels, such as the dollar sign in the y-axis label, and the underscores throughout (these are considered special characters in LaTeX). Lastly, the result of running the <code>tikz</code> command is that a <code>.tex</code> (LaTeX source code) file is produced. This isn't quite the plot image file we want. It _does_ however have the commands to generate one. The last steps in the above gist are to process this <code>.tex</code> file with LaTeX (here I used the <code>tools::texi2dvi</code> function, but one _could_ also use a <code>system</code> command to their $\LaTeX$ installation.
