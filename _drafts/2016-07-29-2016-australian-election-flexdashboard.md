Here in the land down under we've finally completed our Federal election. We complain that it seems to go on for too long, but it's a flash in the pan compared to the USA electoral process. This year turned out to be quite eventful, with what might appear to an outside observer to be a conspired attempt at a perfect split vote (a hung parliament).
