Here in the land down under we've finally completed our Federal election. We complain that it seems to go on for too long, but it's a flash in the pan compared to the USA electoral process. 

<!--more-->

This year turned out to be quite eventful (when aren't they these days?) with what might appear to an outside observer to be a conspired attempt at a perfect split vote (a hung parliament). In the end, it seems the incumbent Liberal/National Coalition managed to form government in their own right by the slimmest of margins, with one electorate triggering a recount when the margin dropped to a single vote. 

Things run a little more smoothly here because we (functionally) follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system" target="_blank">Westminster system</a> for electing a party rather than a specific leader, a fact that has resulted in our having 5 Prime Ministers (4 unique) in the last 6 years, despite elections being held every 4 years. Structurally, we are similar to the United States Congress in that we have a House of Representatives elected from single-member constituencies of approximately equal population, and a Senate consisting of an equal number of Senators from each state, regardless of population. The election is decided based on how many electorates each party can win such that they can form a majority government. There are currently 150 electorates, so a party requires 76 to gain full control without having to go into talks with the minor parties.

This year, with voting completed and counted (eventually) the Liberal/National Coalition held 76 seats and can govern in their own right. Given that electorates are defined to be of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistribution_(election)#Australia" target="_blank">approximately equal population sizes</a>, this means that the majority of people voted for that party, right? Right? Let's see.

In terms of open data, Australia doesn't do too bad. We have a few underutilised resources, such as <a href="http://data.gov.au" target="_blank">data.gov.au</a> (building an R interface to that site is on my to-do list), <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/" target="_blank">the Australian National Data Service</a>, <a href="https://researchdata.ands.org.au/" target="_blank">Research Data Australia</a>, and <a href="http://www.govpond.org/index.php" target="_blank">GovPond</a> and the <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/" target="_blank">Australian Electoral Commission</a> (via the <a href="http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDefault-20499.htm" target="_blank">Virtual Tally Room</a>) is one of the better agencies in terms of data availability.
