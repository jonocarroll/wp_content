Here in the land down under we've finally completed our Federal election. We complain that it seems to go on for too long, but it's a flash in the pan compared to the USA electoral process.

This year turned out to be quite eventful (when aren't they these days?) with what might appear to an outside observer to be a conspired attempt at a perfect split vote (a hung parliament). In the end, it seems the incumbent Liberal coalition managed to form government in their own right by the slimmest of margins, with one electorate triggering a recount when the margin dropped to a single vote.
