If that's not a great band name then I don't know what is (hint: I don't know what is).

At the start of the year I set out my 'goals for 2018' just like many of us do; an overly ambitious list of things we'd like to do to better ourselves. My list includes improving my French to better interact with a colleague I'll be cohabitating and working with (my 48 day streak on Duolingo was interrupted by travel... c'est un bon début); reading more books (two a month, so far so good); writing more blog posts (one a month, this one included); and interacting more with the R community. 

My original plan for the increased interaction was to pick a package a month. I'd pick a package which didn't already have a vignette; learn the package, write a vignette, submit it as a PR, and blog about the experience. This seemed straightforward enough. People have long complained about the lack of vignettes in R packages (https://juliasilge.com/blog/mining-cran-description/ -- an analysis I intend to reproduce/update). I looked through my backlog of interesting packages I meant to look at more closely and checked to see if they already had vignettes... all of them did (womp womp).

For those not familiar, vignettes in R packages are long-form documentation. Not just a listing of each function, but a good solid walkthrough of background, a use-case, examples, motivations, pitfalls, comparisons, performance metrics, and so on. Function documentation rarely provides sufficient detail like this, so vignettes are a convenient way to include some longer discussions about your package. The problem is that people either neglect to, forget to, or aren't aware that they can (and should!) write vignettes for their packages. How does one go about it? What tools are required? How do I include that in a package? I'm glad you asked. Over the next few months I'll be blogging about vignettes; how they're currently used, how they might be more useful, and how we might be able to get people to use them more.

For now, stay tuned!
