Open-source software is awesome. If I found that a piece of closed-source software was missing a feature that I wanted, well, bad luck. I probably couldn't even tell if was actually missing or if I just didn't know about it. When the source is available, maintained, and documented however, things get fun.

I've thought for a couple of projects which had bar-graphs that it would be neat to have the categories labelled by an icon or a picture. Say, the logo for a company or an illustrative example. There are probably very few cases for which this is technically a good idea (trying to be a featured author on <a href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com/" target="_blank">JunkCharts</a> might very well be one of those reasons). Nonetheless, there are at least a couple of requests for this floating around on Stackoverflow; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29939447/icons-as-x-axis-labels-in-r-ggplot2" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8905101/how-can-i-use-a-graphic-imported-with-grimport-as-axis-tick-labels-in-ggplot2-u" target="_blank">here</a> for example.
