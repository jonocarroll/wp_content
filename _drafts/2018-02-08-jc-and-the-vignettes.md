At the start of the year I set out my 'goals for 2018' just like many of us do; an overly ambitious list of things we'd like to do to better ourselves. My list includes improving my French to better interact with a colleague I'll be cohabitating and working with (40 day streak on Duolingo so far); reading more books (two a month, so far so good); writing more blog posts (one a month, this one included); and interacting more with the R community. 

My original plan for the increased interaction was to pick a package a month. I'd pick a package which didn't already have a vignette; write it, submit it as a PR, and blog about the experience.
