I've been using the reticulate package occasionally for a while now, so I was surprised to see that it had only just been officially released. It's a brilliant piece of work, allowing python and R to coexist in the same workflow.

Another opportunity came up today to use it so I thought it might be nice to do a very quick blog post to show just how easy it is to take external python code and have it callable directly from R. In this case, @coolbutuseless posed a challenge on Twitter to write a fast 'needle in a haystack' search of a small vector inside a larger one.
