They say "if you want to find an answer on the internet, first present a wrong one presented as fact. Then wait."

It didn't take long, actually. Despite my searches while trying to get <a href="http://jcarroll.com.au/2016/06/02/images-as-x-axis-labels/" target="_blank">images into x-axis labels</a> it seems I overlooked a working, significantly less hacky implementation. My Google-fu had in fact let me down.

Baptiste Augui√© (<a href="https://twitter.com/tpab" target="_blank">@tpab</a> / <a href="https://github.com/baptiste" target="_blank">@baptiste</a>) had this working a while ago, and in a definitively less hacky way. I've added a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jonocarroll/2f9490f1f5e7c82ef8b791a4b91fc9ca" target="_blank">new gist</a> (if you're reading this on R-bloggers, the gist isn't embedded, so either follow the link or view on m) which implements it on the same graph as earlier, and I like this significantly more.
